      "paragraphs": [
        "The Learning Field was founded on the belief that every child deserves an education that honors their individual needs, strengths, and learning profile.",
        "Early on, the founder recognized a significant gap in specialized, school-connected support for neurodivergent learners—particularly at the intersection of school, family, and everyday life. This insight led to the creation of The Learning Field: a practice grounded in respect, professional expertise, and evidence-based approaches.",
        "The work of The Learning Field is shaped by both lived and professional experience. The founder is herself ADHD-identifying (diagnosed later in life) and a mother of two neurodivergent children. Since 2016, she has worked as an early childhood and elementary educator in Switzerland, with extensive experience in classroom management, school systems, and close collaboration with families. She also brings leadership experience from school administration, along with advanced professional training in school development, educational leadership, ADHD, and autism—including training completed in the United States.",
        "Today, The Learning Field partners with educators, schools, and families to support a deeper understanding of neurodivergent children and to create practical, supportive strategies for everyday school life. The approach continues to evolve and is informed by current research in neurodiversity and education—so that the \"learning field\" of possibilities can grow for children and the adults who support them."
